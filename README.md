shitty mincraft mod manager so i dont have to update my mods folder every update
ill add onto it later

sample `config.json` 
```json
{
    "version": "1.20.4",
    "mods_path": "mods/",
    "mod_slugs": [
        "sodium",
        "modmenu",
        "fabric-api"
    ]
}
```

only supports mods on modrinth for now

i plan to add shit to this + curseforge support so :3

## How to use
put config.json in the directory and build it yourself

not that hard
